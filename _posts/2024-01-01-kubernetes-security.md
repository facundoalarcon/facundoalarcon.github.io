Taking advantage of a new year holiday, I visit my parents in Formosa and I decide to upload an update of this blog (yes, I left it a little bit abandoned for some months). But take it easy, fellows. It was a time of learning and making presentations for conferences in the last quarter of 2023. Now, on the first day of 2024, I decide to merge all the previous posts in my idea KISS. I had the honor of presenting this idea at the EkoParty Cybersecurity Conference last November. I’m going to leave the videos of the talks in this post, yes, because they were two talks in two different Eko’s spaces, Blue and DevSecOps.

## About KISS

KISS (Kubernetes Infraestructure Security Standard) emerges as an idea to secure kubernetes clusters in multi-cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Baremetal) of a giant company with hundreds of clusters that can be created dynamically at any moment by users who need them, from different teams. Where with my team we do not manage the cluster but we need to secure it. All this and much more is explained in the talks. They are only in Spanish, fortunately on youtube you can activate subtitles so I hope it is not a problem (in case you do not know how to do it I leave you the sequence you must follow). I hope you enjoy listening, as much as I did when I designed this solution and if I’m lucky maybe it will solve some problem for you or arouse your curiosity or some idea. I accept suggestions, and constructive criticism, you know where to contact me.
